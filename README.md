# Triangle Area Calculator

'Triangle Area Calculator' is the project for TCSS460: Client/Server Programming for Internet Applications in Summer 2022 at The University of Washington Tacoma.

## The objectives of this project are:
1. Design a complete REST API using Node.js that contains four or more microservices.
2. Create each microservice associated with a specific route representing a specific functionality.
3. Create an HTML web page that interacts with and consumes (or uses) the four microservices.
4. Publish the web application.

## There are four microservices of this project:
1. Calculate the triangle area by giving the base and height.
2. Calculate the triangle area by giving the length of three sides.
3. Calculate the triangle area by giving the length of two sides and the included angle.
4. Calculate the triangle area by giving the two angles and the included side length.

## To Run the backend using Node.js on VS code locally.
1. Download/clone code from GitHub repo: [https://github.com/A-Kannika/akannika-a3]
2. Open the project folder using VS code
3. Run ```node Node.js``` or ```npm run nodemon``` to run the server locally.
<br>Your server is running when you see this message in the terminal.

Once your server is running, you can access to the front-end application via [http://127.0.0.1:3000/]

## Summary
This project was challenging to create compelling designs for both the back-end and front-end and connect the back-end to represent the front-end. These four microservices motivate me to develop and create more microservices in the future.
